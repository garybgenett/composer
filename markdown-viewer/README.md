# Content Options

Option          | Default | Description
:---            | :---    | :---
**emoji**       | `false` | Convert emoji :shortnames: into EmojiOne images
**scroll**      | `true`  | Remember scroll position
**toc**         | `false` | Generate Table of Contents
**mathjax**     | `false` | Render TeX and LaTeX math blocks

## Scroll

- When enabled, the `scroll` option remembers the current scroll position and scrolls back to it after page load.
- When disabled, the `scroll` option either scrolls to the top of the document or to a certain header (anchor) if a hash URL fragment is present.

## TOC

- Generates Table of Contents (TOC) based on the headers found in the markdown document.

## MathJax

The following `mathjax` delimiters are supported:

- inline math: `\(math\)` and `$math$`
- display math: `\[math\]` and `$$math$$`

The following rules apply to your content when `mathjax` is enabled:

- Regular dollar sign `$` in text that is not part of a math formula should be escaped: `\$`
- Regular markdown escaping for parentheses: `\(` and `\)`, and brackets: `\[` and `\]` is not supported. MathJax will convert anything between these delimiters to math formulas, unless they are wrapped in backticks: `` `\(` `` or fenced code blocks.

> The MathJax support currently works only on local file URLs and remote origins without strict *Content Security Policy (CSP)* set. For example it won't work for files hosted on the GitHub's `raw.githubusercontent.com` origin. However you can bypass this by enabling the [Disable CSP](#disable-content-security-policy) option.

## Emoji

- Emoji shortnames like: `:sparkles:` will be converted to :sparkles: using [EmojiOne][emojione] images.
- Currently unicode symbols like `âœ¨` and ASCII emoji like `:D` are not supported.

> The Emoji support currently works only on local file URLs and remote origins without strict *Content Security Policy (CSP)* set. For example it won't work for files hosted on the GitHub's `raw.githubusercontent.com` origin. However you can bypass this by enabling the [Disable CSP](#disable-content-security-policy) option.


# Advanced Options

Detecting and rendering [local file URLs](#local-files) can be enabled by using the `Allow access to file URLs` option for the extension.

Access to remote URLs however, needs to be enabled manually.

## Add Origin

Here is how you can enable the extension for the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` origin:

![add-origin]

The origin consists of *protocol* part and *domain* part. The *protocol* can be either `https`, `http`, or a `*` to match both `https` and `http`.

Enable the above origin and play around with the extension options [here][syntax].

## Allow All Origins

In case you really want to you can enable the extension for **all** origins:

![all-origins]

Alternatively you can use the `Allow All` button.

**Important:** Note that all remote origins should either serve their markdown content with valid `content-type` header (see [Header Detection](#header-detection)) or valid URL path (see [Path Matching](#path-matching)). Otherwise the following rules take place:

Consider this example:

![allow-all]

1. In this example we have allowed all origins `*://*` (the first entry) with the default Path Matching RegExp, meaning that all origins are going to match **only** on those URLs ending with markdown file extension.<br>
For example this is going to match: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simov/markdown-viewer/master/README.md<br>
However it's important to note that the `*://*` (Allow All) origin serves as a **fallback**. Its Path Matching RegExp will be used only if any other explicitly added (more specific) origins fail to match, meaning that all other explicitly added origins **override** the `*://*` (Allow All) origin and therefore its Path Matching RegExp!

2. For example let's assume that our imaginary origin `asite.com` (the second entry) serves markdown files on a custom path: `https://asite.com/some/custom/path/to/serve/markdown/`<br>
In this case we'll have to **explicitly add** an entry for `asite.com` and modify its path matching RegExp even if the extension was enabled for all origins!

3. Now take a look at the third entry. GitHub is a good example of a website that serves rendered HTML content on URLs ending with markdown file extension.<br>
For example we would like the extension to render:<br>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simov/markdown-viewer/master/README.md<br>
but not:<br>
https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer/blob/master/README.md<br>
In this case we want to **exclude** the `github.com` origin althogether. To **exclude** an origin you have to set its path matching RegExp to something that's **impossible to match**!

4. Moving on to the forth entry. What if we want to match things like:<br>
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/raw/master/README.md<br>
but not:<br>
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/README.md<br>
Notice the subtle difference between the two URLs - the first one contains the `raw` word in its path. Now take a closer look at the screenshot above and you'll notice that the `gitlab.com` entry have a slightly modified path matching RegExp too - it have the `.*\/raw\/.*` string prepended in front of the default RegExp that matched every path ending with markdown file extension.<br>
The result is as you might expect, the first URL:<br>
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/raw/master/README.md is going to be matched and rendered by Markdown Viewer, however the second one:<br>
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/README.md will be **excluded**!

## Header Detection

When this option is enabled the extension will check for the presence of the `text/markdown` and `text/x-markdown` *content-type* header before trying to match the path:

![header-detection]

## Path Matching

If the header detection is disabled or a proper *content-type* header is missing, the extension will check if the URL is ending with a markdown file extension:

![path-regexp]

It's a simple regular expression that matches URLs ending with:

- markdown file extension: `\.(?:markdown|mdown|mkdn|md|mkd|mdwn|mdtxt|mdtext|text)`
- and optionally anchor or querystring after that: `(?:#.*|\?.*)?`

> The `?:` used in `(?:match)` stands for *non-capturing group* and it's there for performance reasons.

You can modify the path matching regular expression for each enabled origin individually. The settings are being updated as you type.

## Remove Origin

At any point click on the small `x` button next to the origin that you want to remove. This actually removes the permission itself so that the extension is no longer able to inject scripts into that origin.

Note that the Chrome's consent popup shows up only when you add the origin for the first time. In case you re-add it you'll no longer see that popup. That's a Chrome thing and it's not controllable through the extension.

## Refresh Origin

The extension synchronizes your preferences across all your devices using Google Sync. The list of your allowed origins is being synced too, but the actual permissions that you give using the Chrome's consent popup cannot be synced.

In case you've recently added a new origin on one of your devices you'll have to explicitly allow it on your other devices. The little refresh button next to each origin is used for that.


## Disable Content Security Policy

Some remote origins may serve its content with a `content-security-policy` header set that prevents the extension from executing certain JavaScript code inside the content of the page. For example on `raw.githubusercontent.com` certain things such as remembering your scroll position, generating TOC, displaying MathJax or Emojis won't work.

Using the `Disable Content Security Policy` switch you can optionally tell the extension to strip that header from the incoming request and therefore allow its full functionality to work:

![disable-csp]

It's important to note that even if you enable this option, the Content Security Policy header will be stripped **only** for those requests that either have a correct [Markdown Content Type](#header-detection) or URL that matches any of your explicitly allowed origins and their corresponding [Path Matching](#path-matching) regexes.

Even if you have [Allowed All Origins](#allow-all-origins) and disabled the Content Security Policy at the same time, the header will be stripped **only** for those requests that either have a correct [Markdown Content Type](#header-detection) or URL that matches your explicitly set [Path Matching](#path-matching) regex for the Allow All origin `* *`.

# Markdown Syntax and Features

A few files located in the [test] folder of this repo can be used to test what's possible with Markdown Viewer:

- Add the `raw.githubusercontent.com` origin through the [Advanced Options](#advanced-options)
- Navigate to the test files: [syntax][test-syntax], [mathjax][test-mathjax], [yaml][test-yaml], [toml][test-toml] and play around with the `Compiler` and `Content` options
- Use the `Markdown/HTML` button to switch between raw markdown and rendered HTML
- At any point click on the `Defaults` button to reset back the compiler options

> Note that in order for the extension to fully function on the `raw.githubusercontent.com` origin you have to enable the [Disable CSP](#disable-content-security-policy) option.

# More Compilers

Markdown Viewer can be used with any markdown parser/compiler. Currently the following compilers are implemented: [marked], [remark], [showdown], [markdown-it], [remarkable], [commonmark], [markdown-js].

1. Clone the [compilers][compilers] branch
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Make sure that the `Developer mode` checkbox is checked at the top
4. Disable the Markdown Viewer extension downloaded from the Chrome Store
5. Click on the `Load unpacked extension...` button and select the cloned directory
